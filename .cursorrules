# Coding Standards

## General Rules
- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- Write simple, understandable code
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful comments only when necessary
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Keep line length reasonable (max 100 characters)

## Logging
- Use structured logging with Winston
- Include context in logs (gameId, playerId, etc.)
- Log at appropriate levels: error, warn, info, debug
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Architecture
- Keep business logic separate from API layer
- Use service classes for complex operations
- Keep core game logic pure and testable
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
